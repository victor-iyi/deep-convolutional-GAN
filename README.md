## About Deep learning 

**Deep learning** is no doubt the hottest topic of the past 8 years in the field of _Artificial intelligence_. Various researchers and scientists have built on each others work to develop a very powerful model to achieve human level intelligence.

Most of this has been quite successful over the years. Thanks to large datasets and huge computing power (esp. Nvidia) we can now deploy some of this models in our various workspace and achieve state-of-the-art results.

## About Tensorflow

[**Tensorflow**](http://tensorflow.org) is an open source deep-learning library developed by Google. This library is no doubt the most popular deep learning library amongst the deep learning community. Tensorflow comes with a great visualization tool known as _**tensorboard**_.

Tensorflow as lots of prebuilt machine learning models that you can just use right out of the box. It also allows you to develop your own custom model relatively easily and push it to production without any modification. _**"It no longer makes sense to use one separate framework for development and one for production"**_. This is why tensorflow as gained a lot of ground amongst the researchers, developers and engineers of Artificial Intelligence.

## About this repository

This repository was made in order to help beginners of machine learning and deep learning exploit the simplicity in machine learning and deep learning. This repo introduces several machine learning models and concepts:

* Logistic Regression

* The Perceptron

* Multi Layer Perceptron

* Convolutional Neural Network

* Ensemble Methods

* Inception/GoogLeNet

* Adversarial Examples

* Deep dream

* Transfer learning

This notebook is well documented and was designed not to bore the reader, because you might as well go read _**"Learning Long Term Dependencies with Gradient Decent is Difficult"** by Yousha Benjio_, you get the gist... ðŸ˜„
